Computational Cost Analysis Guide: To achieve an 80-bit security level, we employed two different strategies. First, for schemes based on pairing operations, we opted for the Type 1 pairing provided by default in the MIRACL library, with implementation details available in the source file ssp_pair.cpp. Second, for schemes based on Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), we chose the secp160r1 elliptic curve. In the MIRACL library, by executing the files 'T_bp.cpp', 'T_pm.cpp', 'T_ecc.cpp', 'T_ep.cpp', and 'T_htp.cpp', we can calculate the average execution time for ten thousand iterations, allowing us to assess the computational costs associated with different cryptographic operations.

Transmission Delay Calculation Guide: To cater to the requirements of various communication schemes, we have not provided a standard Beacon.msg message definition file. This necessitates that users design and implement the message structure tailored to the specific needs of their scheme. Within the 'Transmission_delay.cc' file, we have supplied the essential functionality for calculating transmission delay. To make effective use of this feature, necessary code modifications are required within the Veins simulation environment to this file. This involves replacing the existing 'veins/modules/application/trace/MyVeinsApp.cc' file with your modified version of 'Transmission_delay.cc'. This procedure ensures accurate timestamp marking and transmission delay calculation during the process of message sending and receiving.
