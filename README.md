In the Miracl library, by running T_bp.cpp, T_pm.cpp, T_ecc.cpp, T_ep.cpp, and T_htp.cpp respectively, one can obtain the average execution time for ten thousand iterations of the corresponding cryptographic operations.
For the Transmission delay. cc file, you only need to replace it with the veins/modules/application/trace/MyVeinsApp. h file in the Veins simulation platform to calculate the transmission delay.
